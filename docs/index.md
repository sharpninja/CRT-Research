# Introduction

> Ignorance is the common cause of racial or religious intolerance and the only real cure of ignorance is knowledge. Intolerance is very often manifested by genuinely unprejudiced persons because they lack the proper information. Religious persecution, racial discrimination, and class prejudice, are shown by persons whose ignorance causes them to fall easy prey to rabble-rousers or professional agitators. The problem of obliterating ignorance from our midst devolves on all those who hope to find strength in justice and attain respect through the equity of their cause; the solution of this problem lies on the doorstep of those who are disposed to investigate the truth. Nothing breeds prejudice so much as ignorance and the danger of prejudice is that it calls forth automatic emotional responses which make people act without thinking. ([Samuels, Westerman, 1946](References#Ref1))

## What is this site?  

For many years I have watched with dismay as our school systems have become more and more distracted with procedures and policies that have harmed the education of all children in America.  I graduated High School in 1989, just in time to not be impacted by the largest political movement in this country's history.  I am speaking of CRT.  I have become acutely aware of the source of my angst through my wife, who is a teacher.  She is currently working on a second master's degree and so I am frequently exposed to what she is being force-fed by professors steeped in the CRT Movement.  To keep myself from going insane trying to understand the things she is being taught, I have decided to create a body of research about CRT and link it together into a bigger world-view that is impacting our lives on a daily basis.

## What You Will Find

Lots of quotes with links to source materials (where available, there's a lot of information locked behind paywalls, not out in the open where people can easily reference them).  Occasionally I will also place my thoughts about a quote or topic.  Eventually there will be enough material here to post my own theory about how CRT has been weaponized to stamp out individuality while simultaneously dividing us up much the same way that the Soviet Union implemented the social construct of race in the first years of the USSR through the 1960s.  The academic thought and behavior of early 20th Century Marxists is not dissimilar from that of the loudest voices in the CRT Movement.
