# Critical Race Theory Terminology

* [x] Injustice
  > ... injustice is defined as inequalities rooted in the socio-economic structure of society, including exploitation, economic marginalization or deprivation of classes or class-like groups. ([Cochran-Smith, 2009](https://independent.academia.edu/marilyncochransmith?swp=rr-ac-4346572))
* [x] Intersectionality
  > Kimberlé Crenshaw, a legal scholar, created a term to describe our multiple identities: _intersectionality_. Crenshaw explains that our identities are like traffic flowing at an _intersection_ – one identity may flow in one direction while another identity is flowing in a different direction. ([Flowers, 2019](https://www.edi.nih.gov/blog/communities/intersectionality-part-one-intersectionality-defined)) 

  > “Intersectionality” is a widely used (and sometimes misused) concept in contemporary social science. The term addresses the question of how multiple forms of inequality and identity inter-relate in different contexts and over time, for example, the inter-connectedness of race, class, gender, disability, and so on. The term originated in the work of U.S. critical race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw (1995) ([Gillborn, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414557827))
* [x] Race
> ‘‘race as a social construction; it is invented, and yet is embedded in our society and in our everyday actions with the world’’ (Leonardo, 2009, p. 3). ([Gillborn, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414557827))
* [ ] Racism
> Because racism is an ingrained feature of our landscape, it looks ordinary and natural to persons in the culture. Formal equal opportunity—rules and laws that insist on treating blacks and Whites (for example) alike—can thus remedy only the more extreme and shocking forms of injustice, the ones that do stand out. It can do little about the business-as-usual forms of racism that people of color confront every day. (Delgado & Stefancic, 2000, p. xvi) ([Gillborn, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414557827)) 
* [ ] Colorism - 
* [ ] White Supremacy
 > in CRT White supremacy refers to the operation of much more subtle and extensive forces that saturate the everyday mundane actions and policies that shape the world in the interests of White people (see Ansley, 1997). ([Gillborn, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414557827)) 
* [ ] Whiteness
  > “Whiteness” is a racial discourse, whereas the category “white people” represents a socially constructed identity, usually based on skin colour. (Leonardo, 2009, p. 169) ([Gillborn, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077800414557827)) 
* [ ] Blackness - 
* [ ] Social Justice Schooling -
