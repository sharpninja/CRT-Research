# The Role of Intersectionality in CRT

## Open-Endedness of Intersectionality

In particular, the AAPF highlight the importance of intersectionality as a tool (of analysis and resistance) rather than as an academic tactic or fashion. Similarly, Richard Delgado (like Crenshaw, one of the founder’s of CRT) has highlighted the need to remain clear sighted about our goals rather than become engaged in never-ending academic games of claim and counter-claim.
